# Robot Interview
This project illustrates how companies can save time and resources in the hiring process by replacing in-person interviews with automated virtual interviews. 

## Features
* First, the application allows the users to submit resumes for specific jobs on the website. If the submitted resume meets 80% of the requirements, the applicant is approved to move on to sign up for an interview date within the date range that the employer can preset.

* Secondly, during the interview, the robot interviewer asks the users (applicants) a combination of behavioral and technical questions.

* Lastly, at the end of the interview, the application sends the entire chat history to the hiring manager for review, and whenever the pplicant logs in, they can check the status of their application.
